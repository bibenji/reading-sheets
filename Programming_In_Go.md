In UTF-8 (and 7-bit ASCII) the character '0' is code point (character) 48 decimal, the character '1' is code point 49, and so on. So if, for example, we have the character '3' (code point 51), we can get its integer value by doing the subtraction '3' - '0' (i.e., 51 âˆ’ 48) which results in an integer (of type byte ) of value 3.

Go uses single quotes for character literals

byte, int32, int64
