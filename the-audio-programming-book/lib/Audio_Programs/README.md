# Audio Programs 

The audio programming exercises from [The Audio Programming Book](http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/audio-programming-book) covers basic audio signal processing techniques.
The purpose of these exercises is to develop my own personal understanding of digital signal processing.

The audio exercises covers 2 chapters of the book: 

* **CH1** - play and display "raw" binary soundfiles 
* **CH2** - generate waveforms, write them to a soundfile, and modify and combine sounds  

In addition, a few libraries have been created or modified to accompany the programs:

* **gtable** - generates table lookup values for several waveforms 
* **portsf** - soundfile I/O library from the audio programming book 
* **wave** - waveform generators 
* **breakpoints** - generate breakpoints for waveform modulation
